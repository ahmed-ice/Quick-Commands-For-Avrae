# Quick-Commands-For-Avrae
Tired of writing the same thing for avrae all the time. Setup this little script and just click on your commands to copy it to paste on discord.

Quick Commands for Avrae.

1. Run commands. On python 3. 
It needs the tkinter and pyperclip
I will roll out an exe as soon as I know how to.

2. The script needs 3 txt files, namely:
Attack
Checks
Spells

2a. If you run it for the first time, the files will be created automatically for you.
After that you want to STOP your script.

3. On respective files. Write down what you need for your character.
eg. In your attack file, write down your attacks, on each line seperately
Check github examples on how the files would be for a level 1 Human/Ranger.
(worst idea because he got no spells)
Simply change to what you want.

4. Run script again. If the files are there it should work smoothly.

5.Simply click what you want to do

5a. It will show the rest of the options you wrote in  the files.

eg. To make an attack. Simply click attack and the scipt should show
what has been copied. Click rest of your options in the order you want.
The text below updates. Showing you what has been copied.

6. And just paste on discord.

7. clicking on !attack or !check or !spell. Will autmatically reset the text copied.

This is my first coding work uploading to github!. Hope you guys find it useful!
